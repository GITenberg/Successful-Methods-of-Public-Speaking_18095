description: You can acquire valuable knowledge for use in your own public speaking
  by studying the successful methods of other men. This does not mean, however, that
  you are to imitate others, but simply to profit by their experience and suggestions
  in so far as they fit in naturally with your personality. All successful speakers
  do not speak alike. Each man has found certain things to be effective in his particular
  case, but which would not necessarily be suited to a different type of speaker.
  When, therefore, you read the following methods of various men, ask yourself in
  each case whether you can apply.
